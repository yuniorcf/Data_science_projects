## - A bit more about me
Motivated by curiosity, a desire to learn and create, I have built my professional history on the basis of scientific thinking. I have been trained to exploit high scientific impact techniques such as Magnetic Resonance, supported by the use of various computer tools and programming such as Python, Matlab, Bash, Mathematica. I have experience in theoretical calculations, simulation of physical processes and statistical analysis as well as machine-learning prediction models. Due to my continuous eagerness to learn and search for new challenges, I have started my journey towards data science. I have a special interest in applying my acquired knowledge in data mining to contribute significantly to branches such as science or industry. I am confident that the challenge inherent in the search for new horizons will significantly boost my professional career.



## - About this repository
This repository contains some of the Data Science-related projects I have been working on

### Projects :

### [1. Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellation](Hotel_booking_demand/)
The goal of the project is to preict booking cancelation based on different features on the dataset. To do that we will do some minimal feature engineering and different ensemble-based Classification models will be tested. In addition a basic classification keras model are tested as well.


### [2. Fraud_detection_in_credit_cards](Fraud_detection_in_credit_cards/)
The goal of the project is to predict fraudulent transactions in order to banks to make decisions on time when risky-looking purchases are detected. First of all we did an exploratory data analysis and proceed to test eight different models. Because the dataset is highly imbalanced we used the SMOTE function from imbalanced-learn library to overcome the data imbalance. Although all the tested models showed a good accuracy score, Five of were above 0.99.
