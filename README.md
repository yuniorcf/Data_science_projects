This repository contains some of the Data Science-related projects I have been working on

# Projects :

## [1. Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellation](Hotel_booking_demand/)
The goal of the project is to preict booking cancelation based on different features on the dataset. To do that we will do some minimal feature engineering and different ensemble-based Classification models will be tested. In addition a basic classification keras model are tested as well.


## [2. Fraud_detection_in_credit_cards](Fraud_detection_in_credit_cards/)
The goal of the project is to predict fraudulent transactions in order to banks to make decisions on time when risky-looking purchases are detected. First of all we did an exploratory data analysis and proceed to test eight different models. Because the dataset is highly imbalanced we used the SMOTE function from imbalanced-learn library to overcome the data imbalance. Although all the tested models showed a good accuracy score, Five of were above 0.99.
